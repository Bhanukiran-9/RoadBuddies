Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

Node.js (version 12 or higher)

1. **Clone the Repository.**
   - git clone https://github.com/your-username/roadrides.git
2. **Install Dependencies.**

3. **Configure Environment Variables.**
 - Create a .env file in the root directory of the project and provide the necessary environment variables.
 - Example:

   - EMAIL = 'server_email_for_sending_messages_to_the_clients'
   - PASSWORD = 'SETUPPASSWORD'
   - SECRETKEY = 'KEY'
   - MONGODBSTRING = 'YOUR_MONGODB_STRING'
